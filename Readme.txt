cliper.py 
... is the main program. Run it just as before.

cliper.ini 
... is the configuration file used by cliper.py, which specifies different sites to be CliPer-ed. Currently we have just ANL. 

cliper_example.ini
... is just an example of cliper.ini (not used by cliper.py), which has two copies ANL in the config file (one does 4 hour forecasts the other 6 hours ahead); but they are essentially the same site. Custom options like the file names and other things can be added there. Then save this file as cliper.ini to be used by cliper.py.

utility.py 
... holds generic functions (not specific to ANL)

anl.py 
... is the ANL site specific CliPer function. Other sites will have different functions, although, none will use CLiPer because the data format is quite specific.

*.DAT
Downloaded and generated by anl.py

data_get.py
Builds data_*.pcl (in binary, to read quickly) = data_*.txt (ASCII, for human reading), the climate record file in a specified format that will be used by cliper.py. This is run only once.

*.pyc
Python generates these when running in script mode (a C code to run faster).
On the first run, CliPer will download the climatology data for "both" 
sites. On subsequent runs, CliPer finds the climatology data and will skip this step.

cleanup*.py
This removes all unnecesary files to start fresh. Linux uses "rm" in lines 4-8. MS Windows uses "delete" in lines 4-8.
